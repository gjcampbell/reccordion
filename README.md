# Reccordion - Screen Recorder

For when screenshots need to animate. 



## Contribution

There's a lot of room for improvement! Add a feature or fix a bug, and submit a PR. Here are some ideas:
- Improve shapes. Add more shapes, add point translation, rotation, text rotation, 
- Improve export. Exports should be clearer, faster, and smaller
- Add keyframes and animations for shapes
- Add effects layers and zooming
- Support Mac and Linux
- Clean up the code. There is a ton of slop, trial and error, and experimentation muddying the code base.
